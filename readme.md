## FAQ

#### Why HampTerminal?

Visualizing Mass Markets is hard. It's all in the numbers. Lots of Alpha here, you just have to look for it.

#### Why isn't my terminal launching?

If you are on Windows make sure you are using PowerShell 7 (may have to download it)

Double check your pip install and make sure everything is installed correctly.
